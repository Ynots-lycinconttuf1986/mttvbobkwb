Wow, okay. So I just stumbled out of Honeymoon Crasher and my head. Is. Spinning. 🌪️ The theater was like a zoo or maybe a beehive, loud buzz everywhere, popcorn scattered like confetti at a 5-year-old’s birthday. Crunch crunch under my shoes. And my back, ugh, feels like I sat on a camel for two hours, not a chair.

But the movie. Oh man. It’s like they took the idea of love and smashed it with a hammer, then glued it back with those awful glitter glue sticks. Do you remember the part where the groom—what's his name? Tim? Jim?—was all I need space but then, hilariously, gets trapped in this tiny, weird elevator with his ex? 😂 It’s like the universe was a mischievous cat playing with a ball of yarn. 

> There was this wild car chase in the middle of a wedding speech — like who does that? Reminded me of that time we tried to order sushi in the middle of a thunderstorm. Total chaos but somehow everything worked out. And the bride, oh my god, she's like a walking hurricane, swirling drama and heartbreak with lace and satin.

Someone asked me to download the movie. Honestly, just go watch the movie first. Big screen, loud sound, the whole shebang. Hits differently, y'know? 

The ending...I'm still not sure what to make of it. It’s like trying to unscramble a mixed fruit salad – like, do the pineapple bits really go with strawberries? Probably. Somehow. My phone was buzzing, kept thinking I’d lost it under the seat but there it was, winning hide and seek. I believe that everyone in the theater was feeling this weird collective what now? Just staring at credits like they're some ancient hieroglyphics.
